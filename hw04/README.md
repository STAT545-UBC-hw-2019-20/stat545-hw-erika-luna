For some reason that I cannot understand (I've tried for hours), the R Markdown document is not properly knitted. I put a [link](https://stat545-ubc-hw-2019-20.github.io/stat545-hw-erika-luna/hw04/hw04.html) here in case it eventually updates. My complete assignment can be found on the .RMD document.
